After many years I have finally taken the time to setup a real website that represents me.  It doesn't do anything and as such isn't very interesting.  However after looking around at the curtain style scrolling sites I'd seen everywhere, the real inspriration came from the [Microsoft build conference website](http://www.buildwindows.com/).

Going off of this I tried to really take a shot at doing some interesting UI work (at least to me), as I haven't done real HTML UI work sinceâ€¦ well ever really.  I also wanted to take this as an oppourtunity to try and learn some more CSS and specifically SASS.  Sass is seriously now my best friend, I used to hate doing css but sass I can grasp for some reason, the syntax of css I guess was just bugging me.  

At any rate after working on it for quite a bit this is now the new website and the first thing that uses a browser that doesn't use javascript heavily that I've worked on it a long time.

Let me know what you think, obviously the content of the site itself is still being hashed out but the site is functional and looks rather good I must say.   

So take a look and let me know what you think.
