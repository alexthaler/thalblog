Today I read a post on reddit that reminded me of why I spend so much time on that site.  It all started out with a post titled "Worlds Population" and linked to the followig image.

Looking at this, it seriously blew my mind.  However I didn't have the reaction that a few on the comments did when they pointed out that the amount of land within that circle is actually much larger than displayed.  Looking further throught the comments I found this was definitely true and, of course, a relevant XKCD.  

It started when someone posted this image of the actual size of Africa that obviously conflicted with the posted images scale.

Along with an awesomely relevant West Wing clip (I've always had this on my to watch list but it's now right at the top and on netflix!) that's definitely worth the 4 min watch.

Finally culiminating in a great revised map created by another redditor showing, in fact, how much larger the area is.

Please forgive the basically reposting of a reddit post, I know it happens often enough already.  However this seriously blew my mind so much I really wanted to at least save it so I could reference it later.  I always knew of the other maps you could reference but never understood how big a difference they actually presented.`
