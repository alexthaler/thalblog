As you can probably tell the blog has undergone a major update and upgrade.  I'm still working on the themeing and UI so expect more updates to come.  

The blog is now being generated using [wintersmith](http://jnordberg.github.com/wintersmith/) which so far has been awesome (thanks jnordberg).  The change was partially because of my issues with Octopress and syncing across multiple repos.

I am working on some tools to aid in publishing a blog with winterpress which I will probably post later.  Until then please bare with me and the odd themeing.  

Update: Now with 100% new theme.  Custom changes are still coming.
