Wanted to make a quick post about the new site I just finished up recently called Horae (Hoe-rai).  This site is basically just a wrapper for the Metra rail-time tracker on their site.  I built it out partially because their UI wasn't ideal and also to try and make something super simple so everyone could use it.  

The result is [Horae](http://horae.herokuapp.com).  

It's mobile optimized so you can easily check the train status at the station or quickly bring up the upcoming trains as you're walking there.  I know the design leaves something to be desired but give me a break I'm just getting into this whole HTML/CSS thing :).  

At any rate just wanted to make a quick post about it.  I might expand this later to go more in depth into the code but that'll have to wait for another night.  

The source is also up on my [github](http://www.github.com/alexthaler/Horae).
