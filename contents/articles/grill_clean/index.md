Since we had a burst of warmth here in Chicago recently I figured I'd clean up my grill to get ready for summer.  Earlier in the winter I had a sizeable grease fire take place and had to douce it with half a pound of flour, leaving it in this state.

Now after a good cleaning it looks much less like there was a snow explosion.
